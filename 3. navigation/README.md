# All about me

In this exercise, we will merge the 2 previous exercises into one application with 2 views.

- About: contains information about you from **About me** exercise
- Palette: contains your favorite color Palette from **Coolers** exercise

## Steps

### Create your screens

- [X] Create a directory called `screens`
- [X] Under `screens/` directory, create 2 components `AboutMe.js` and `MyPalette.js`
- [X] Bring your code from the 2 previous exercises into the newly created components

### Implement navigation between screens

For this exercise, we will use [Tab Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation/)

- [X] Install the needed dependencies by running

```
$ npm install @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-navigation/bottom-tabs --save
```

- [X] Follow the guide in the documentation to implement the navigation
- [X] Add icons to your Tabs. Use [IonIcons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) for this
