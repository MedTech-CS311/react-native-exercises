# About Me

In this exercise, you'll build a one view mobile app that introduces you to people. An empty Expo project was created for you

## Getting started

- [ ] Start the project by running `npm start`
- [ ] Use **Expo Go** on your mobile device to preview the changes

## Steps

- [ ] Open `App.js` file, all the changes will be made here
- [ ] Remove the boilerplate code. You should have an empty component
- [ ] Use `SafeAreaView` component to make sure your content is not interfering with the screen borders of your device
- [ ] Use `View` and `Image` to add image of yourself. You can use a URL or import for this.
- [ ] Use `Text` to add your name and your life motto
- [ ] Use `Button` with the value **connect** that should navigate to your github profile on press
- [ ] Apply some styling using `StyleSheet`.
  - Change the background color
